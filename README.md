# Problem Statement

One of the main challenges faced by companies conducting customer surveys is obtaining accurate and meaningful feedback. While traditional surveys rely on text-based responses, some customers may struggle to express their thoughts and emotions in writing, leading to incomplete or inaccurate feedback. To address this challenge, there is a growing need for surveys that allow customers to provide audio responses that are then transcribed into standard language. Additionally, providing audio questions in the user's preferred language can improve the customer experience and increase response rates. Finally, sentiment analysis and analytics can help companies gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
